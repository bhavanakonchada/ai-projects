## AI Agents

This project includes production-ready AI agents designed for Azure AI Foundry:

### [Ticket Classifier Agent](./agents/ticket-classifier/)
A customer service automation agent that analyzes incoming messages and classifies them for proper routing. This agent is designed to work within an orchestrated multi-agent system.

**Features:**
- Analyzes customer messages for priority assessment
- Classifies tickets by department (technical, billing, sales, general)
- Categorizes issue types (bugs, features, account issues, etc.)
- Provides confidence scores and routing recommendations
- Integrates with orchestrator agents for automated workflow

**Quick Start:**
1. Navigate to `agents/ticket-classifier/`
2. Review the configuration files in `config/`
3. Follow the deployment guide in `docs/deployment-guide.md`
4. Test with sample tickets from `examples/`
